# CryptoExchAutoBot-Python

## Description

This project involves developing a Cryptocurrency Exchange Automation Bot that facilitates random transactions across various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon blockchain networks. The primary function of the bot is to automate the process of executing swaps with specified parameters, enhancing the efficiency of transaction management across multiple addresses.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Support:** Operates on the Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon chains, targeting exchanges such as SushiSwap, Uniswap, and 1inch.
- **Multi-Address Management:** Capable of managing multiple addresses simultaneously.
- **Customizable Transaction Goals:** Allows users to set a target range for the number of transactions (e.g., 10-15 transactions).
- **Adjustable Delay Intervals:** Users can define delay timeframes between transactions (e.g., 60 to 600 seconds).
- **Token Swap Flexibility:** Specify the range of Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC) tokens to be swapped (e.g., 0.0001 to 0.005 ETH).
- **Randomized Selection Process:** Randomly selects the blockchain network, DEX platform, swap pairs, and the amount of cryptocurrency to be exchanged based on user inputs.

## Supported Swap Pairs

- **Optimism and Arbitrum Chains:** ETH-USDT, ETH-USDC, ETH-WETH.
- **Polygon Chain:** MATIC-USDT, MATIC-USDC, MATIC-WMATIC.

## Requirements

The bot must be designed with transparency in mind, with all code made open source for third-party review.
